# YOLO v3 PyTorch Implementation
I made this repo to implement YOLO Version 3 in PyTorch for research purpose. 
In this repo, I will use PASCAL VOC dataset to train the network. 
To built this repo, I exploring another repo that implement yolov3 in pytorch. 
I use some of the other repo code and modified what is fit into my repo.

 ## Code of Inspiration
 In order to built this repo, I had to explore yolo v3 implementation in pytorch from github and other sources.
 And these are the list for github repositories or articles that I've read in order to built this repo:
